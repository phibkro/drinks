# Drinks

[[_TOC_]]

## Project description

Share your drink recipes and review others!
Drinks is a full stack app for viewing and reviewing drink recipes!
It is built with modern web technologies like React, Typescript, Tailwind and GraphQL.

## Setup dev environment

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install` in the root directory to install dependencies for the frontend and backend

### Backend

- Spin up a postgres database
  - Mac
    - I use [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) to host my database and [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) to interact with it
    - You can also use [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/postgresql@13#default)
    - Or [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
- Create a `.env` file in the `/server/prisma` directory
- Add the database url to the `.env` file
  - `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>"`
- Run `npm prisma:reset` in the `/server` directory to create the database schema and seed it with mock data
- Your backend is now ready to go!

### Update database schema

- Run `npx prisma migrate dev` in the `/server` directory to create the new database schema

### Generating seed data

To generate our seed data we use the [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) API.

Ingredients data was downloaded from [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/list.php?i=list) and manually cleaned and prepared for use in `server/src/prisma/seed.ts`.

All drinks data was downloaded from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ai-first/cocktail-ingredients/).
The data was manually cleaned,
then converted to JSON using `server/src/lib/csvToJSON.ts`.
Furthermore it was cleaned and prepared with `server/src/lib/createDrinksSeed.ts`.
These programs can be run with `npm run run:drinksToJSON` and `npm run run:drinksToSeed` respectively within the `server/` folder.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` runs the app and server in development mode
- `npm run start` runs the app and server in production mode
- `npm run test` runs tests for the app and server
- Prefix `start` with `server:` to run only the server
- Prefix all commands with `app:` to run only the app

More specific commands you find by checking out the subrepos `/app` and `/server`

## File structure

- `app/` contains web app code
  - `index.html` configure metadata here
    - is technically the main entry point for the application
  - `public/` contains public assets
  - `src/` contains the main code for the application
    - `assets/` contains private assets like images and fonts
    - `components/` contains components our team has written
      - `ui/` contains shadcn/ui components
    - `hooks/` contains our custom hooks
    - `pages/` define separate pages in the application
      - Importantly have the responsibility of data handling and conditional rendering
    - `server/` contains code related to fetching data from the server
    - `lib/` contains different utilities
      - Basically "etc." but for code reused throughout the application
    - `App.tsx` is where we apply our app layout
    - `global.css` defines css variables and resets default styling
    - `main.tsx` is the main entry point for our application
      - Here providers, routing and styles are added to the application
    - `router.tsx` is where we handle routing
- `data/` contains static mock data
- `server/` contains server code
  - `prisma/`
    - `schema.prisma` defines the database schema
  - `src/` contains the main code for the server
    - `index.ts` is the main entry point for the server
      - Here we define the server and connect it to the database

## Semantic versioning

We use semantic versioning to keep track of our releases.

App versioning is unnecessary as the consumers of our app are not dependent on a specific version of our app.

Our server/backend is versioned as it is a public API that is consumed by our frontend.

Please refer to <https://semver.org/> for more information.

## Tech-stack

### Typescript

Typescript is essential for our workflow as it provides us with type safety and a better development experience (DX).

### Linting

ESlint is used for linting. Our configs lie in .eslintrc.cjs. To manually test the linting of the project run the command

`npm run lint`

### Formatting (Prettier)

Prettier is our choice of formatter.
To manually format the project run

`npm run format`

in the app directory.\
Our team prefers to use the VSCode Prettier extension with the "Format on save" option enabled.
That way it is practically impossible to push unformatted code.

`.prettierrc` contains our configurations so everyone has the same formatting rules.
These are set to the defaults with the exception of enabling plugins.

#### Plugins

The plugins we use are:

- "prettier-plugin-organize-imports"
- "prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"

These sort and clean up our imports and tailwind classes so to avoid meaningless merge conflicts.

### React

Javascript frameworks are a staple of modern web development and React is our choice for its popularity and ease of use.

### Vite

Vite is our required frontend build tool. No configuration is required outside of whats included in the repo.

### Tailwind

Tailwind is our choice for in-line styling.
It is popular for good reasons.
The development experience (DX) it provides lets us focus on making a good website without having to bother with the intricacies of plain css.

### shadcn/ui

Shadcn/ui or Shadui for short is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.
This is not a component library in the sense that it is not a dependency.

We use shadcn/ui components as our base and build on top of the sensible defaults it provides.

### Zustand

Zustand is our choice of state management library.
It is a simple and lightweight library that provides us with uncomplicated global state management.
A choice like Redux would be overkill for our use case.

### React Router

React Router allows us to employ URL path routing in our Single Page Application (SPA)

#### Implementation

- All pages are wrapped within `<App />` which contains layout elements like a universal header
- Search Page (/): Users can search for and are presented with a myriad of cocktail recipes
- Details Page (/cocktail/:cocktailId): Displays information specific to the cocktailId parameter
- Error Page (*): Displays if a routing error occurs, for example navigating to an undefined page url

```jsx
const rootPath = import.meta.env.BASE_URL
export const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: rootPath,
    element: <App />,
    errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
    children: [
      {
        path: rootPath,
        element: <SearchPage />,
      },
      {
        path: "details/:drinkId",
        element: <DetailsPage />,
        errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
      },
    ],
  },
  ]);
```

### Testing with Cypress

Cypress is our choice of testing library for its ease of use and its excellent E2E testing environment.
To open the Cypress testing app run `npm run cypress:open` and it will automatically open.
From there on you can choose whether to run component or end-to-end (E2E) tests.

#### Component testing

We do not write custom tests the shadcn/ui components as it is a stable "library" and we are not tinkering with its primitives.

#### End-to-end testing

Our most important tests are our e2e tests that ensures the app works as intended for our users.

### PostgresQL

PostgresQL is all we need for our database.
We could have chosen to make a project using a graph database,
but for that choice to make sense it would require us to make for example a social media app with a lot of relations, like Twitter(X) or Facebook.

### Prisma

Prisma makes it incredibly easy to implement a database in our stack.
It gives us type safety when defining our GraphQL resolvers and a simple way to interact with our database.
It also provides us with a way to seed our database with mock data.

### GraphQL

GraphQL is an effective and environmentally friendly way to query data from a server.
We recognize that GraphQL might be overkill for our use case as we have a fairly simple relational database.
However, we want to use GraphQL to learn. (And it is a requirement for the course ðŸ˜‰)
A realistic application would either have a more complex database with more data or use a graph database like Neo4j to justify the use of GraphQL.
Personally, I would use TRPC as our frontend and backend are written in Typescript,
but GraphQL is more flexible as it is language agnostic.
It is also more stable as it is a more mature technology with a large community.

### Apollo server and client

Apollo is the easiest way to implement GraphQL in our stack.
It is important not to overcomplicate our stack with too many libraries and Apollo is a good choice for that reason.

Apollo server is used to implement our GraphQL server.

Apollo client is used fetch data from our GraphQL server in the frontend.

## Accessibility

We implemented the Shadcn/ui library, which is built on top of Radix, designed with accessibility in mind. For remaining gaps, we added aria-label to necessary components, such as interactive buttons.

We made the website keyboard-friendly so that users can navigate through the site using only the keyboard (tab, enter, space, and arrow keys).

The website also features dark mode, both to protect sensitive eyes and to reduce power consumption on screens. Speaking of which...

## Sustainability

We chose to use low-resolution images from our dataset, considering that the quality from other images was unnecessary. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred, which in turn reduces the energy consumption of the website. We could have gone further and converted them to WEBP instead of PNGs, but we decided that the time spent on that would be better spent on other features.

In our ApolloClient we implemented InMemoryCache which stores results from the GraphQL queries in memory. This can result in reduced network traffic, faster data responses and optimized resource usage. Which leads to reduced energy consumption.

## Code style

### Commit messages

We follow the conventional commits specifications described in <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>

[more concise and web oriented document](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13)

We also use the conventional commits VSCode extension for ease of use
